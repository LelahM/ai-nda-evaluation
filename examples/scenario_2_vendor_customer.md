# Scenario 2: Vendor-Customer Relationship

## Scenario Description

MedDevice Corp, a medical device manufacturer, is evaluating CloudSoft Solutions as a potential vendor for a custom software platform to manage patient data and device monitoring. The evaluation process requires CloudSoft to access MedDevice's existing system architecture, regulatory requirements, patient data schemas, and clinical workflow specifications. This is primarily a unilateral disclosure from MedDevice to CloudSoft, with potential for limited reciprocal sharing of CloudSoft's development methodologies.

**Key Considerations:**
- Primarily unilateral confidentiality (MedDevice → CloudSoft)
- Healthcare data and regulatory compliance requirements
- Vendor evaluation context with potential for competitive bidding
- HIPAA and medical device regulatory considerations
